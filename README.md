### Steps to install chrome extension manually

- Download the extension as a zip/rar file.
- Give the extension files a permanent home. Chrome will need continual access to these files for the extension to work, so the file path cannot change. This means donâ€™t leave the files on your desktop or downloads folder where you may accidentally tidy them up or delete them later.
- In Chrome, navigate to chrome://extensions/ Now drag and drop the extension from your file manager anywhere onto the extensions page in Chrome.

Done! The extension is installed and you are ready to go.
